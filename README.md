# Uniform-Cost-Search-UCS-Romania-Map-Problem

This is an implementation of UCS for Romania Map Problem which one of most basic and most used problems for understanding of Search Algorithms in AI
Map data has been converted to a python graph.The implementation is done . As this data is read it is stored in a dictionary, that behaves like an adjacency list; therefore, each key is a parent node and the keys are its children allowing for searches and traversals to be done efficiently.The Cost of each edge is provided in definition of graph

Only set up necessary is if you want the program to spit out all of the possible results by running a script that feeds it all of the possible input.

I used this assignment to become more familiar with search algorithms that are commonly used in AI programs/machines and as a refresher of packaging and creating modules in python. Please feel free to offer any suggestion in making program work more efficiently.

Thanks
